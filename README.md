# Space_Sim

The plan is to create a cozy, space sim in which you decide on the number of planets and moons and it automatically simulates the gravity, revolution and collisions kinda like a movie.

Day 1 - 30 Minutes - Set up everything and first half of basic solar system simulation using real astronomical values
