Hey!

-This is primarily an engine and only a simulation for visual appeal, this is a finished engine which can be used to run tests by specifying values and other necessary data. It contains everything from a gravity test module to a check for life, atmosphere, climate and habitability in the engine which are not available in the simulation


This is a 2d Planatery Physics Engine/Simulation:-
-The Engine Part(The 5 physics related modules, informations and HUD).
-Made for Moonshot!

-Usage of AI:- AI has only been used to teach me formulae, concepts and planning, and also used partially for fixing bugs.
