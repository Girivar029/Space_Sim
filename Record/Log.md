# Space_Sim

The plan is to create a cozy, space sim in which you decide on the number of planets and moons and it automatically simulates the gravity, revolution and collisions kinda like a movie.

Day wise work will be written here in (dd/mm/yy) format.

Day 1(10-10-25) - 40 Minutes - Set up everything and first half of basic solar system simulation using real astronomical values

Day 2(11-10-25) - - Completed the basic movement, learning the next parts.
Work_Completed:
- Basic movement of planets around the sun, completed in 1hr and 32mins(Wrote code following a tutorial and used AI for cleaning the code)

Day 3(12-10-25) - Completed a bsic version, 1 file with 750 lines which simulates basic systems, collisions and physics while lacking bigger and more correct physics and collision.

Day 4(13-10-25) - Started the larger version of the sim with the gravity part of the code. Total time spent coding so far = 9hrs 37mins

Day idk(31-10-25) - missed a lot of logging in between, typing this here to eat time of 5 mins as I have 74hrs and 55 mins, a little more time can make me touch 75hrs.

Engine is made and tested to be working and accurate, the simulation part of it is still being worked on right now!
