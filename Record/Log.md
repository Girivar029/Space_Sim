# Space_Sim

The plan is to create a cozy, space sim in which you decide on the number of planets and moons and it automatically simulates the gravity, revolution and collisions kinda like a movie.

Day wise work will be written here in (dd/mm/yy) format.

Day 1(10-10-25) - 40 Minutes - Set up everything and first half of basic solar system simulation using real astronomical values

Day 2(11-10-25) - - Completed the basic movement, learning the next parts.
Work_Completed:
- Basic movement of planets around the sun, completed in 1hr and 32mins(Wrote code following a tutorial and used AI for cleaning the code.)
