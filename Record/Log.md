# Space_Sim

The plan is to create a cozy, space sim in which you decide on the number of planets and moons and it automatically simulates the gravity, revolution and collisions kinda like a movie.

Day wise work will be written here in (dd/mm/yy) format.

Day 1(10-10-25) - 30 Minutes - Set up everything and first half of basic solar system simulation using real astronomical values

Day 2(11-10-25) - - Plan is to finish the basic setup and contine onto implementing the other parts of the idea.
