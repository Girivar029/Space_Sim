##Constants##

1.Universal Gravitational Constant
G = 6.67430 * 10^-11 
-Determines strength of gravity.
-For every force calculations.

2.Speed of Light
c = 299,792,458
-Max speed limit in the univere.
-Used in post newtonian calculations and other calculations.

3.Schwazschild Radius
r_s = 2GM/c^2
-Event horizon radius of a black hole. 
-Determines use of relativistic gravity.

4.Softening Parameter
r^2 eff = r^2 + E^2
-Prevents infinte force.
-Used in force calculations.


##Core Force Calculations##

1.Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
-Accurate for solar system calculations.
-Breaks near blackholes, high speeds and other extreme environments.

2.Post Newtonian Corrections
-Relativistic correction to newtonian gravity.
-Gravity is slightly stronger than what newton predicted, hence these corrections.
-Needed for high velocities, strong gravity and close orbits.

3.Schwarzschild Force
-Exact solution for gravity in spacetime near a blackhole.
-Spacetime is warped near blackholes hence, better calculations are required.

4.Tidal Force
-Gravitational gradient across extended body caused stretching/compression.
-Ocean tides, Tidal heating(Jupiter), Tidal disruption(Roche limit).

5.Roche limit
-Critical forces below tidal forces tear apart sattelites.
-Ring formations in saturn, uranus etc.

6.Plummer Softening
-For maintaining energy conservations and smooth derivations.

7.Gravitational Potential
-Scalar field representing gravitational potential energy per unit mass.
-Used for energy conservation, to show gravitational landscape, Lagrange points.

8.Escape velocity
-Minimum speed to escape to infinity without further propulsion.
-Necessary in large simulations where multiple planets, stars and blackholes exist.

9.Orbital velocity
-Speed needed for stable circular orbit.

10.Hill sphere
-Region where sattelite's gravity dominates over central body.
-Moon orbits must be inside the Earth's Hill sphere to be stable.

11.Tidal Heating Power
-Friction from tidal deformation converts orbital energy to heat.
-Potential for life in unlikely planets.
