Basic Orbital Mechanics
-All orbits are elliptical.

Sun centric orbits:
-Periphilion is the closer point and Aphelion is the farthest point.

Elliptical Orbits:
-The velocity of an orbiting satellite can be calculated for Periphilion and Aphelion respectively.
-Velocity at periphilion = (2*(E+U/periphilion r))**0.5
-Velocity at Aphelion = (2*(E+U/Aphelion r))**0.5

Two main forces affect a sattelite/moving object:
-Centrifugal & -Centripetal

Centrifugal Force: A force due to the kinetic energy of the sattelite pushing outwards.
Centripetal force: A force due to gravitational pull of the planet pulling towards the earth.

-For a sattelite/planet to remain stable, thesee 2 forces must equal out and balance each other.

Gravitational force = GMm/r**2
Orbital velocity = (GM/r)**0.5
