###Gravity.py###

-Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature. It is used to describe the attraction between objects that have mass, essentially pulling each other towards themselves.

-Basic gravity formula given by newton is: F = G((m_1*m_2)/r^2)

-General relativity: This theory by Einstein expands newton's law, and trying to explain phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves especially at high masses or very strong gravity.

-Tidal forces: Gravity pulling closer to one side of an object, stretches it.

-Gravitational Potential: This is used to describe the potential energy landscape created by masses. High potential meaning higher gravity, making it harder to escape its sphere of influence.

-Escape velocity: The minimum speed required to break free from a body's gravitational sphere of influence.

-Hill sphere: This is the region around an object where its gravity dominates over others, important for orbits and moons.


###Orbits.py###

-Orbital mechanics is the study of how objects move under the influence of gravity, especially in systems like the solar system.

-Keplers Laws(derived from observation of planets around the Sun)

1st law - Orbits are elipses, not perfect circles.
2nd law - Objects in orbit always travel equal distance per unit of time.
3rd law - The square of the period is propotional to the cube of the average distance.
