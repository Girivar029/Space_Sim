###Planning###

#Structuring#

#Physics Modules
-Gravity.py: Gravity of planets, stars, supernovas and blackholes
-Orbits.py: Orbital Velocity and Ordering or Reasoning for orbiting(for planets to revolve around bigger ones or stars or black holes.)
-Distances.py: Reasoning for distances and calculations of impact of gravity
-Other_Physics: For any remaining physics formulae and reasoning
-Collisions.py: Accurate collisions using saved data

#Camera And Input Management
-Camera.py: Takes care of camera stuff like zoom, focus, positioning, movement etc.
-Input_Management.py: Takes care of user input and assigning uses to it.

#Celestial Bodies
-Stars.py: Accurate physical measures of stars scaled down before calculations to make it easier and a more optimised system. It also states requirements for star formation and mass etc.
-Planets.py: Accurate physical measures of planets which is also scaled down, also states all its details for better collisions.
-BlackHoles_&_Supernovas.py: Similar to Stars.py

#UI & HUD
-UI.py: Shows the UI on screen
-Data.py: Saves additional data for UI or HUD

#Scenarios
-Solar.py: Simulates the solar system as a whole
-BlackHole.py: Simulates many planets with 1 blackhole
-Supernova.py: Similar to BlackHole.py
-MultiBlackHole.py: Similar to single blackhole but has multiple.
-MultiSupernova.py: Similar to MultiBlackHole.py
-Random.py: A random no of planets and stars.
-Random_BH&SN.py: Random.py but with chance of blackholes and supernovas
-Custom: User decides.

#Main
-Main.py: Stiches everything together and runs the sim.
