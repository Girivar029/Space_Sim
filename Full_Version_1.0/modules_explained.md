The information module modles planetary characteristics and simulation data.It calculates physical properties,environment,and habitability.Core components include HabitabilityMetrics,BodyInfo,and SimulationInfo classes.HabitabilityMetrics computes life probability based on water,oxygen,pressure,temperature,tidalforces,and magnetic field.BodyInfo stores planetary data like mass,radius,density,and dynamically updates surface temperature,tidal forces,water level,magnetic field,and habitability using input parameters.SimulationInfo manages a central body and orbiting bodies, estimating luminosity for energy input,and updating all BodyInfo instances to reflect current planetary conditions.

Additional specialized modules extend planetary detail.ClimateModel simulates temparature gradients by latitude, adjusts for greenhouse factors,and models seasonal cycles.HydrologyModel manages ocean coverage,evaporation, and precipitation,simulating waterr volume changes.BiosignatureAnalyzer analyzes atmospheric gases, scoring the likelihood of biosignatures detecting life indicators.GeologyModel estimates volcanic and tectonic activity with mountain height distributions and crust thickness.AtmosphericModel calculates gas composition,pressure,molecular weights,scale height, and surface density adapting to dynamic planetary environments.MagneticFieldModel simulates planetary dynamos,magnetic field strength,and time-dependent decay influenced by core conductivity and spin rates.

All these classes are parameterized for flexible, variable planetary systems.Calculations depend on real-time properties,promoting realistic,evolving planetary conditions.The modular design supports comprehensive planetary and habitability simulations with detailed data output.This forms a complex,long-running informational backend essential for visualizations and scientific modeling within your planetary simulation system.
